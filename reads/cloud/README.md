## Case study
Scenario:

A global supplier is looking to **modernize its order processing system**. Among other things, this system includes **Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Shipping, Invoicing, and Raw Materials modules**. Most of their current system is built on a **mainframe stack** which is **several versions behind** in terms of system upgrades and patches, and, while the modules used by the company are provided with out-of-the-box implementations by the mainframe vendor, the **company has chosen to heavily customize those modules over multiple years**. Internal users interface with the modules of the system using **"green screen"** terminals. There is a **thin web layer** for presentation to and utilization by external users which submits **Message Queueing (MQ) calls to the mainframe** for the back-end business logic.
The supplier wants to migrate from their Data Center to the Cloud due to the potential in cost savings and the opportunity to enhance and expand their business and its profitability.

Discuss and research with your group:
- What types of Cloud services (either from the previously discussed list or others) would you recommend using for this modernization effort?
